# Vue Chat-App

This is a chat app I made to get better at Firebase and Vue in general.<br>
I dont recommend using this code for an actual app since it may have security flaws and such, it is only for fun and educational purposes<br>
[**Live Demo**](https://portfolio.zerio-scripts.com/chat)

## Technologies

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [VueJS 3.0](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Sweetalert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/)

## Installation

Simply unpack all of these files into a folder and run `npm install` through a console window with that folder opened.<br>

# Usage

### Dev server

This is great if you dont have a server to host the built files on, after doing the installation instructions run `npm run dev` in your console window and it will open a local dev server on port 3000 which you can access from `http://localhost:3000`

### Building

This is only useable / possible if you have an actual server to run these built files on. Run `npm run build` in your console window and it will build the files into the `dist` folder. You can then upload these files to your server and it should work.
